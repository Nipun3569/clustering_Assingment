# clustering_Assingment
This repository contains a comparative performance study of different clustering algorithms using various pre-processing techniques and evaluating them on different parameters. The analysis is conducted on three datasets: "perfume","ipl" sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The clustering algorithms employed include K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.

# Contents
    Notebook: The main analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook named assingment_clustering.ipynb. This notebook is implemented in Google Colab for easy accessibility and reproducibility.

    Datasets: The datasets used in this assignment are "perfume","ipl".The datasets are loaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    Results: The results, including tables, graphs, and conclusions, are provided within the notebook. The evaluation parameters include cluster silhouette scores, intra-cluster distance, and other relevant metrics.

# Usage
1.Open the Clustering_Assignment.ipynb notebook using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2.Follow the step-by-step analysis, including loading datasets, applying clustering algorithms, and evaluating their performance.
3.View the tables and graphs illustrating the comparative study of different clustering algorithms with various pre-processing techniques.
4.Conclude the findings based on the evaluation metrics and insights gained from the analysis.

# Conclusion
The clustering assignment provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms on different datasets. The evaluation metrics and visualizations aim to assist in understanding the strengths and limitations of each algorithm under various scenarios. The results and conclusions are detailed in the notebook.

Feel free to explore the notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis and results. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue in this repository.
